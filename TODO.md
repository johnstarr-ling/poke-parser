# TO-DO LIST 
In this file, I outline some features that I'd like to incorporate into the `poke-parser`.

### Current Projects:
- [] Batch processing HMTLs for...:
  - [] Weekly statistics
  - [] Aggregate statistics 
- [] Parsing HTML files for:
  - [] Kills per mon
  - [] Winner/loser of match
  - []Hazard/status detection 
  - [] Saving chat (?)
- [] Clean & modular outputs
  - [] Potentially distinct directories for weekly & aggregate computations


### Future Projects (Time Permitting):
- [] More advanced match statistics that were requested on Discord
- [] Most frequent chatter & how many messages they sent
- [] Most & least damage giver (how much percent they gave out)
- [] Most & least damage taker (how much percent they took)
- [] Biggest healer (account for healing wish and wish?)
