# TO-DO LIST 
In this file, I outline some features that I'd like to incorporate into the `poke-parser`.

### Current Projects:
- [x] Finish the parser demo! 

### Future Projects (Time Permitting):
- [] Critical hit ratios (for trainers)
- [] Supereffective/resisted move counts (for mons and trainers)
- [] Joined match counting (for trainers)
- [] Most popular items (?)
